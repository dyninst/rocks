Rocks: Reliable Sockets v2.4
Installation Guide

Reliable sockets currently run on x86 Linux 2.4.

		   Quick (No Configuration) Install

To build and install reliable sockets:

    % make install

The binaries (rock and rockd) will be installed in $HOME/bin.
The library (librocks.so) will be installed in $HOME/lib.
If you want to install them elsewhere, see below.
The manual page (rock.1) will not be installed anywhere.

`make install' requires OpenSSL (we use version 0.9.6).  openssl is
standard in many Linux distributions.  See below for other options.

The OpenSSL homepage is www.openssl.org.

			    Configuration

These configuration variables, defined in make.config, are for users.

INSTALL_BIN_DIR
    The directory in which to install the rocks binaries (rock and rockd).

INSTALL_LIBRARY_DIR
    The directory in which to install the rocks library (librocks.so).

USE_CRYPTO
    If this variable is defined (to ANY value), then authentication is
    enabled.

OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR
OPENSSL_LIBRARY_DIR
    USE_CRYPTO requires various bits of cryptography code.
    Currently we get them from the OpenSSL library.  Set the
    path to the OpenSSL headers and library with these variables.
