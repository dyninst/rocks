       Rock  runs  the  specified  command  over reliable sockets
       (rocks), protecting from failure the  network  connections
       created by the command process and its children.  Recover-
       able failures include those  caused  by  host  IP  address
       change,  extended  periods  of  network disconnection, and
       link failure.

       Rocks must be enabled at  both  ends  of  the  connection.
       Rock  by default assumes that the command process communi-
       cates with rock-enabled remote  peers.   Connections  with
       ordinary  peers, those that do not support rocks, silently
       revert to ordinary socket behavior.

       The --dd option enables reliable socket connections to ordi-
       nary  peers  by  redirecting  the connection through a new
       rockd process, started by rock, on the remote host.  Rockd
       must  be  in  the path of the remote user, either $$UUSSEERR or
       uusseerr.  Use of this option is currently limited to the com-
       mands ssh and scp.

       The  --kk  option  also loads the ckpt checkpoint library in
       the process.

       The --ll option  forces  suspended  rocks  to  reconnect  to
       localhost.   This is useful for process migration of a set
       of processes communicating over rocks.

       Failed connections that cannot be recovered by rocks after
       72 hours are silently closed.

       Start a rocks-enabled sshd on host nob:

              nob# rock sshd

       Start  a  new  rocks-enabled shell, then ssh over rocks to
       nob:

              % rock sh
              % ssh nob

       Start a rocks-enabled remote shell on a host  ("oldskool")
       that does not have a rocks-enabled sshd:

              % rock -d ssh oldskool

       Rock loads code into the command process using LLDD__PPRREELLOOAADD,
       which has its own limitations; see _l_d_._s_o(8).

BBUUGGSS
       Currently rocks only protect TCP connections.

       Rocks are not firewall friendly.

       Connection recovery does not succeed when both ends change
       IP address while disconnected (but note the --ll option)

       Rockd requires you to type your password twice.
